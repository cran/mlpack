preprocess_split(
  input,
  input_labels = NA,
  no_shuffle = FALSE,
  seed = NA,
  stratify_data = FALSE,
  test_ratio = NA,
  verbose = getOption("mlpack.verbose", FALSE)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Matrix containing data (numeric matrix).}

\item{input_labels}{Matrix containing labels (integer matrix).}

\item{no_shuffle}{Avoid shuffling the data before splitting.  Default
value "FALSE" (logical).}

\item{seed}{Random seed (0 for std::time(NULL)).  Default value "0"
(integer).}

\item{stratify_data}{Stratify the data according to label.  Default
value "FALSE" (logical).}

\item{test_ratio}{Ratio of test set; if not set,the ratio defaults to
0..  Default value "0.2" (numeric).}

\item{verbose}{Display informational messages and the full list of
parameters and timers at the end of execution.  Default value
"getOption("mlpack.verbose", FALSE)" (logical).}
}
\value{
A list with several components:
\item{test}{Matrix to save test data to (numeric matrix).}
\item{test_labels}{Matrix to save test labels to (integer matrix).}
\item{training}{Matrix to save training data to (numeric matrix).}
\item{training_labels}{Matrix to save train labels to (integer
  matrix).}
}
\description{
A utility to split data into a training and testing dataset.  This can also
split labels according to the same split.
}
\details{
This utility takes a dataset and optionally labels and splits them into a
training set and a test set. Before the split, the points in the dataset are
randomly reordered. The percentage of the dataset to be used as the test set
can be specified with the "test_ratio" parameter; the default is 0.2 (20%).

The output training and test matrices may be saved with the "training" and
"test" output parameters.

Optionally, labels can also be split along with the data by specifying the
"input_labels" parameter.  Splitting labels works the same way as splitting
the data. The output training and test labels may be saved with the
"training_labels" and "test_labels" output parameters, respectively.

\examples{
# So, a simple example where we want to split the dataset "X" into "X_train"
# and "X_test" with 60\% of the data in the training set and 40\% of the
# dataset in the test set, we could run 

\dontrun{
output <- preprocess_split(input=X, test_ratio=0.4)
X_train <- output$training
X_test <- output$test
}

# Also by default the dataset is shuffled and split; you can provide the
# "no_shuffle" option to avoid shuffling the data; an example to avoid
# shuffling of data is:

\dontrun{
output <- preprocess_split(input=X, test_ratio=0.4, no_shuffle=TRUE)
X_train <- output$training
X_test <- output$test
}

# If we had a dataset "X" and associated labels "y", and we wanted to split
# these into "X_train", "y_train", "X_test", and "y_test", with 30\% of the
# data in the test set, we could run

\dontrun{
output <- preprocess_split(input=X, input_labels=y, test_ratio=0.3)
X_train <- output$training
y_train <- output$training_labels
X_test <- output$test
y_test <- output$test_labels
}
# To maintain the ratio of each class in the train and test sets,
# the"stratify_data" option can be used.

\dontrun{
output <- preprocess_split(input=X, test_ratio=0.4, stratify_data=TRUE)
X_train <- output$training
X_test <- output$test
}
